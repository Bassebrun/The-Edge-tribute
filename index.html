  <ul>
  <li><strong>Born</strong> - August 8th 1961, Barking, UK.</li>
 <li><strong>1962</strong> - Moved to Dublin City,Ireland.</li>
 <li><strong>1976</strong> - David joined a band at Mount Temple Comphrehensive High School.</li>
 <li><strong>1976</strong> - David's band became U2 and he became known as<strong><em> The Edge.</em></strong></li>
 <li><strong>1977</strong> - David got his first delay, an Electro-Harmonix unit.</li>
 <li><strong>1978 - Present</strong> - David has developed his unique sound, using a host of different amps, guitars and signal processing devices, such as digital delays.
 <li>David's main equipment are VOX AC30 amps, Korg SDD 3000 digital delays, TC-2290 digital delays, Eventide Harmonizers, stompboxes and pedals. All rack mounted units are controlled with an onstage switching system, allowing David to call up any amp and any presets on the signal processing devices, for any song in the setlist.</li>
 <li>An important feature/technique in David's sound is, to palm-mute the strings and strike the strings with grippy part of a Herdim (blue) pick. This makes the classic chimey "Edge sound".</li>
 <li>David continues to record albums and tour with U2. He has inspired countless of young guitar players around the world and is always working on new sonic master pieces.

<!--Moms quote-->     
<p class="col-xs-12" id="edge"> "He started playing when he was 14. Once David got the guitar in his hands, he wouldn't put the blooming thing down. And we'd be saying, "Would you shush now a minute, we just want to hear the news."
- Gwenda Evans on David's early dedication to the guitar.
